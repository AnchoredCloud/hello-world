stuff on my mind
Hi, im Vycka, in 2018 I started my IT course and im pretty green with any type of coding, 
so I came here to learn, copy, edit and create. My mind is hungry to learn, 
but I always need the easiest and the most basic explanation there is, 
because fake it 'till you make it doesn't work for me.
I am not afraid to say that I don't understand and I will keep saying that until I do 
or either until my will power resources are empty, its sad but I'm easily discouraged.
